# Another Keyboard Builder
An exact mechanical keyboard plate creator that doesn't result in 13.99999mm cutouts

### Why?
Alternate generators don't have either the features or exactness that designers need.

### Features
- Filleting. Fillet all corners during generation so Fusion 360 doesn't have to crash 50 times later attempting it.
- A variety of cutout options to meet the requirements of each plate.
- Exactness. No more 13.99999mm or 14.00001mm cutouts; this generator will always use exact, accurate dimensions.

### Usage
todo

### Issues
- Still in progress
- Larger layouts still don't render correctly

### Todo
- More stabilizer cutout options.
- More switch cutout options.

Some features to be based on https://github.com/swill/kad in the future.
